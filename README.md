# <Personal Portfolio>

## First Pass at a Personal Portfolio

In this repo, I created a personal portfolio for the first time. It is not the final product but the basis of what will become my portfolio for continued use. Please review and provide any feedback. Here are the actions taken:

1. Built a portfolio that highlights my projects for potential employers
2. Included an about me page
3. Ensured that HTML & CSS flow logically
4. Added area for future projects and links
5. Added feature: when user clicks navigation tabs, the US scrolls to corresponding sections
6. Attempted to size the first project picture to be larger than the others
7. Attempted a responsive layout that adjusts to various viewports
8. Added comments to HTML & CSS
